## Overview

This app will inform parents about different vaccines out there and also assist them in tracking the vaccine schedules. This app allows parents to add a child all by themselves and enter the info about their children such as age, gender etc., so that the CLSC(vaccination centre) can contact the parents and chat with them in the app to thereby clarify any doubts that they have and therefore get their children vaccinated.

## Goals
#### The main goal of this project is to create a  User-friendly application for the parent in order to help him to get his child vaccinated, letting him track the vaccinations of all his children and even add more children  by himself. 
#### The User can get to know about all the vaccines available out there that are appropriate for his children.
#### The User can place a request for a vaccine to the vaccination centre through the app.
#### The User can schedule a date once the vaccination centre approves the request.
#### The user can always contact the vaccination centre by clicking on contact us.
